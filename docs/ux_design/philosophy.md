# Philosophy

Mobile synthesizers seem to try and mimic more traditional desktop/analog
interfaces, which doesn't pair nicely with mobile.

The goal is to create an intuitive, easy-to-use synthesizer that can be used by
someone with no synthesis experience or a (semi?) professional playing around
with sound design.

Therefore, it should be a serious synthesizer, but fun to use on mobile.
Usability > feature set, since the use-case will be different. (If you're at your computer/studio, use a synth)
